#### plexlad's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles! Everybody has a way to configure everything, and this is my personal preference. I enjoy using OneDark and believe that everything should be simple as possible. The asthetic is important, but not more important than the functionality of the tool.

##### Current Configurations
 * Neovim
 * Oh My Posh

Always in the works!
