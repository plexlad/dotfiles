#### plexlad's dotfiles

Literally the best dotfiles in existence. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong.

These are my dotfiles, my way that I configure everything! My personal preference is that aesthetic is important, but should never overrule the functionality of the tool. With that rule in mind, I also use the One Dark theme and am a JetBrains Mono enjoyer.

##### Current Configurations
 * Alacritty
 * AwesomeWM
 * Kitty
 * Neovim
 * Picom
 * Polybar
 * Other preferences and goodies! (wallpapers and omp theme)

Always in the works!
