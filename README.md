#### plexlad's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, my way that I configure everything! My personal preference is that aesthetic is important, but should never overrule the functionality of the tool. With that rule in mind, I also use the One Dark theme and am a JetBrains Mono enjoyer.

##### Current Configurations
 * AwesomeWM
 * Alacritty
 * Neovim
 * Oh My Posh
 * Little goodies and preferences!

Always in the works!
