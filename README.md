#### plexlad's dotfiles

Literally the best dotfiles in existence. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong.

These are my dotfiles, my way that I configure everything! My personal preference is that aesthetic is important, but should never overrule the functionality of the tool. With that rule in mind, I also use the One Dark theme and am a JetBrains Mono enjoyer.

##### Current Configurations
 * AwesomeWM
 * Kitty
 * Neovim
 * Picom
 * Polybar
 * Rofi
 * Oh My Posh
 * tmux
 * Other preferences and goodies! (wallpapers and omp theme)

Always in the works!

#### Useful Shortcuts

TERM is typed as a command.

##### tmux
 * default root: ctrl+b
 * root d: detach from session (still running)
 * TERM tmux ls: gives a list of tmux sessions
 * TERM tmux attach -t (tmux session): re attaches to an existing session
 * root %: 

##### Custom tmux
 * root h/j/k/l: navigate windows in respective directions
 * root ctrl+j/ctrl+l: create new vertical/horizontal split
